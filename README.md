# Classification with Hyperparameter tuning
- Diabetes classification using the Prima Indians Diabetes Database
- Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database
- Tried various classification algorithms.
- Imporved the accuracy of the models by:
  - Removing outliers from the data
  - Adjusting the hyperparametes of the models
 - Currently, the best model is logistic regression with accuracy: 82.21%, Precision: 77.50%, Recall: 60.78%, and F1-Score: 0.68.
