# Classification with Hyperparameter tuning
- Diabetes classification using the Prima Indians Diabetes Database
- Tried Logistic Regression, KNN classification, Decision Trees and Naive Bayes.
- Imporved the accuracy of the models by:
  - Removing outliers from the data
  - Adjusting the hyperparametes of the models
 - Currently, the best model is logistic regression with accuracy: 82.21%, Precision: 77.50%, Recall: 60.78%, and F1-Score: 0.68.
 
 # To do:
 - Try random forest
 - Find better parameters for other models
 - Look for other features
 - Try removing features with very low corelation
 - Better documentation
